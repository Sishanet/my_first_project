#My first project: 

#I created a folder in computer called Documents using "mkdir".
#Using "cd Documents", i navigated into Documents folder.
#Using "mkdir repo_projects", I created folder called repo_projects.
#Using "git init" I initialized repo_projects as the folder I wanted to connect from remote into the cloud. 
#Using "touch README.md", I created a file called README.md which is this file <3 
# Using "git status", i checked that I was on the main branch
# Then created a repo on github called "my_first_project"
# using "git remote add origin httsp <link given from github>"
# using "git branch -M main" to specify main current as main branch
# "add README.md" to add file to branch
# "git commit -m 'initial commit adds README'" to add changes 
# "git push -u origin main" to reflect remote changes onto github
# edited README.md rn using nano
